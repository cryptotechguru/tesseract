What is Equibit?
----------------

Equibit is a crypto-securities protocol that enables instant issuance and transfer of digital
securities to anyone, anywhere in the world. Equibit uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing securities are carried out 
collectively by the network. Equibit is the name of the open source software which enables 
the use of this network.
